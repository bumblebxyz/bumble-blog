      <description>Seed of an Idea  It started in Fall 2015, junior year of college. Hao and myself were roommates. We were both taking classes on design and manufacturing. Before this, we had each used a 3d printer once or twice for some small projects. But we were never too impressed with what came out. You could get a tiny, flimsy, inaccurate part made in a couple of hours, while more complex prints could take days.</description>
