      <description>So, What is BumbleBeast?  It is a milling machine first - a monsterously powerful one at that. But it does plenty more than the standard desktop mill.  Features  It can machine aluminum alloys at optimal speeds and feeds, with accuracy of 25 microns (0.001 in.) or better. It has 5 axes of movement to reduce production time up to 90% for parts with multi-faced or organic features.</description>

      <description>Seed of an Idea  It started in Fall 2015, junior year of college. Hao and myself were roommates. We were both taking classes on design and manufacturing. Before this, we had each used a 3d printer once or twice for some small projects. But we were never too impressed with what came out. You could get a tiny, flimsy, inaccurate part made in a couple of hours, while more complex prints could take days.</description>
