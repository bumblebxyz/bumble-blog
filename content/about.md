We're committed to making real manufacturing more accessible. 
<br>
<br>
Why can't milling, laser engraving, laser cutting, pick-and-place, water-jet (and so on) all be as accessible as 3d printing? 
<br>
<br>
Because there isn't one great platform that can do it all! 
<br>
<br>
At least there wasn't until <a href="https://bumblebeast.co">BumbleBeast!</a> 
<br>
<br>
Now <a href="https://bumblebeast.co">BumbleBeast</a> is here to bring robust manufacturing capabilities to the hands of engineers, makers, hobbyists, you name it! 
<br>
<br>
BumbleBeast is a robotic system that: 
<br>
<br>
1. Fits on the desktop - just barely!
<br>
2. Has <a href="http://www.5-axis.org/index.php/why-5-axis-benefits-of-switching-to-a-5-axis-machine/">5 axis</a> movement
<br>
3. Can mill aluminum alloys.
<br>
4. Is modular from the ground up.
<br>
