<h4> So, What is BumbleBeast? </h4>
It is a milling machine first - a monsterously powerful one at that. But it does plenty more than the standard desktop mill.
<br>
<br>
Visit <a href="https://bumblebeast.co/#features">our website</a> to learn more about its features and attributes.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Features </h4>
<br>
<h6> Handles the Toughest Jobs </h6>
It can machine aluminum alloys at <strong>optimal speeds</strong> and feeds, with <strong>accuracy of 25 microns</strong> (0.001 in.) or better. 
<br> 
<br>
It has <strong>5 axes</strong> of movement to reduce production time <strong>up to 90%</strong> for parts with multi-faced or organic features. Many organic features simply cannot be made without 5 axes.
<br>
<br>
<h6> Built for Variety </h6>
You can easily change out tools. You can swap a low speed spindle better suited for aluminum and steel for a high speed spindle better suited for plastics and foams. You can even throw an extruder on there for 3d printing if you desire!
<br>
<br>
With 5 axes, you can 3d print an organic part with </strong>no support material</strong>. More on this in a <a href="https://blog.bumblebeast.co/2018/10/benefits-of-5-axis-3d-printing/">blog post</a> to come.
<br>
<br>
<h6> Efficient Size </h6>
It has 300 mm (11.8 in.) x 300 mm (11.8 in.) x 300 mm (11.8 in.) build volume  - and that's with full 5-axis maneuverability! 
<br>
<br>
If you're machining in 3 axis mode only, the <strong>length is doubled</strong>. 
Build volume is 600 mm (23.6 in.) x 300 mm (11.8 in.) x 300 mm (11.8 in.). 
<br>
<br>
The machine itself is 900 mm (35.4 in.) x 875 mm (34.5 in.) x 650 mm (25.7 in.). Pretty compact!
